% 300 words
% Description of the project, what the project provides, its purpose, problems solved, and target audience.

The Content Delivery Network (CDN) Implementation project is designed to enhance the performance, scalability, and reliability of a music streaming and download service by caching audio content at multiple geographically distributed edge locations. By leveraging edge caching, the system reduces latency, improves download speeds, and provides a seamless user experience for streaming music, even during peak usage periods. The primary objective is to ensure that users can access audio files quickly and efficiently, regardless of their location or device, while the backend intelligently manages routing, caching, and content delivery.

The system architecture was developed using Node.js for the backend, which provides efficient server-side processing, request handling, and real-time updates to cached content. The frontend was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, creating a responsive and intuitive user interface where users can easily find, stream, and download music. Together, this technology stack ensures a fast, scalable, and user-friendly experience.

Functionally, the CDN caches music files in multiple formats (MP3, AAC, OGG) at edge servers to maximize compatibility with diverse devices and playback applications. Requests are routed intelligently based on a userâ€™s geographical location and network conditions, ensuring minimal streaming latency. Real-time updates allow new releases and content changes to propagate quickly, guaranteeing that users always have access to the latest music. The system also incorporates analytics to track streaming quality, download speeds, and user interactions, providing administrators with actionable insights.

Non-functional requirements focus on ensuring response times under 100 milliseconds, scalability through the addition of edge servers, and industry-standard security protocols such as encryption and authentication. The system also emphasizes seamless usability with clear feedback and error handling. With built-in monitoring and analytics, the CDN can be continuously optimized for performance and efficiency, making it a robust solution for large-scale music distribution.

%---------------------------DevOps - Continuous Delivery Approach and Results-------------------------------------------------

\section{DevOps - Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery Approach and Results}
%describe your set of practices that enable you to release software quickly, safely, and sustainably by automating the software delivery process, resulting in faster time to market, improved software quality, and enhanced team productivity.

The approach we took for our CI and CD we setting up GIT Actions. This really helped us be able to test our files the moment they are updated and see if there is any errors. We leverage GitHub Actions to implement our CI workflow, which automatically triggers a series of vital steps upon every code push. This includes running a fast build process and executing automated unit tests and integration tests. Automating these checks allows us to catch errors and conflicts early, significantly reducing the cost and complexity of fixing issues later in the development cycle. The immediate feedback loop established by Git Actions ensures code quality remains high, making the entire release process inherently safer. Our CD practice focuses on creating a reliable, repeatable path to production. The same automated pipeline used for testing will also handle the process of packaging the application and preparing it for release to staging or production environments. This standardization removes human error and guarantees consistency across deployments, making releases safer and more predictable. This highly reliable, automated process is the primary driver for achieving a faster time to market for new music content and CDN features.

%---------------------------DevOps - Architecture Approach, Models, and Results-------------------------------------------------

\section{DevOps - Architecture Approach, Models, and Results}
%describe how you designed systems with loosely coupled components, allowing you to work independently, deploy frequently, and scale efficiently, ultimately enabling rapid delivery of software and system reliability.

Our CDN project is designed with a loosely coupled architectural approach, where distinct functional components are logically separated. This modular design is the backbone of our ability to work independently, deploy new features frequently, and ensure efficient system scaling while maintaining high reliability. This strategy ultimately enables the rapid delivery of software value. The Content Origin: The source of truth for audio files (the music directory). Its sole purpose is content storage and serving, decoupled from the delivery logic. The Delivery and Routing Layer: This component, simulated by our Edge Cache and Geo-Routing logic in server.js, handles all user interactions. It independently manages caching decisions, routing, and time-to-live (TTL) updates. The Analytic and Monitoring Service: This block autonomously tracks performance metrics (latency, cache hits) via the /analytic endpoint, ensuring that data gathering is separate from content delivery. The independence of these components drives our operational efficiency. Because the routing logic is decoupled from the content storage, we can update the caching algorithm or geo-routing function without requiring a re-deployment or extensive re-testing of the entire Origin content library. This isolation enables frequent and safer deployments.

\section{Conclusion}
%200 words
%Concluding remarks that summarizes the purpose and outcomes of the technical document.  Discussion of short comings and future work.
In conclusion this project went a bit smoother than the first project we did. This may be because we jumped on it a lot faster than the other. We were able to get the hardest part which was the coding done pretty fast. One thing that we could have improved on was the way we implemented the Music App. We not to sure how to make a complete network for the music app so we only used a local host. Similarly for the edge systems we only simulated it with our code that gave us the response time and the predicted edge system, such as New York, Asia, and more. We downloaded two songs, a longer song (around 7 mins) and a shorter song (around 3 mins). Some thing we didn't know how to implement was the ability to download and upload song remotely. So there was a lot we wished we could have polished out but we had to keep our scope pretty small to complete this project. But overall thanks to this project brought a lot of light to what DevOps was and how to use it to our advantage. We will be able to use these skills in the future.
